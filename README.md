# Kinetic-Remote
Imagine a remote that never needs batteries. This innovative design uses a simple coil and magnet to generate power whenever you press a button. The energy is converted into usable electricity, making the remote both reliable and eco-friendly. Say goodbye to dead batteries and hello to a smarter, greener way to control your devices!

The system consists of 4 main components:
1. Infrared remote control device
2. Faraday voltage generator
3. Charge storage component
4. Voltage regulator

 Working of the Remote
 
 The Batteryless Remote is designed to function without traditional batteries by generating its own power through electromagnetic induction. This is achieved using a 6- inch tube wrapped with a 2000-turn coil, inside which three small magnets move freely.
